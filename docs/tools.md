## convert.mjs
little tool i (snailmusic) made to convert from pixelfactorial's pack format

it generally just takes pack name, then takes the level names and looks em up based on a database built from the `_levels.json` file (which can be adjusted from within the code). it does replace the existing `_packs.json` so watch out lol (make backups!)

usage: `node convert.mjs`
